**Purpose:** This practice is designed to get familiarization with the fundamentals of XUnit.

**Author:** Atinder Pal

**Requirements:**
* Create a new solution with an XUnitIntroPractice console application.
* Add a second XUnit Test project to the solution called XUnitIntroPractice_Tests.
* Add an assembly reference from the XUnit project to the console application.
* Update the Program class to be public, so the test framework can see it.
* Write a method called IsYesOrNo that will accept a string and return true if the string is “YES”, “Y”, “NO”, or “N”, in any casing, trimmed. Otherwise it will return false.
  * Write an XUnit test method that will test the trimming of whitespace (both spaces and tabs) before and after the text.
9 test case permutations.
  * Write an XUnit test method that will test the conversion to uppercase.
  * 3 test case permutations.
  * Write an XUnit test method for all accepted values.
  * 4 test case permutations.
  * Write an XUnit test method for invalid values. Include at least one single character invalid value, one multiple character one, and an empty string.
* Write assertions using Throws<FormatException>, Throws<IndexOutOfRangeException>, Throws<NullReferenceException> and Throws<DivideByZero Exception>, to demonstrate your understanding thereof. You can use built in C# methods.

**Challenges:**
* Write assertions for Throws<StackOverflowException> and Throws<AccessViolationException>.
  * If you can’t get them working, feel free to throw them manually, but please research them and provide links to your research if you do so.
